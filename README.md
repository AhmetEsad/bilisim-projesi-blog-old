# bilisim-dersi-blog
This is a personal blog I made back in 2021 for a school project. It has dynamic asset loading, a progress bar to keep track of how much has loaded, collision detection for coins, etc. There is so much more and I'm very proud of it. After 100 coins or so, a new room gets unlocked where you can change the character speed and the slipperiness multiplier of the floor. You can use Enter to read posts and ESC to close out of them.

## How to Run
- `$ npm i`
- `$ npm server.js`
- visit `localhost:2057` (or `127.0.0.1:2057`) using your browser of choice
